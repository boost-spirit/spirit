[section String]

This module includes different string oriented generators allowing to output
character sequences. It includes variants of the `string` generator.

[heading Module Header]

    // forwards to <boost/spirit/home/karma/string.hpp>
    #include <boost/spirit/include/karma_string.hpp>

Also, see __include_structure__.

[section:string String (`string`, `lit`)]

[heading Description]

The string generators described in this section are:

The `string` generator emits a string of characters. The `string` generator
is implicitly verbatim: the `delimit` parser is not applied in between
characters of the string. The `string` generator has an associated
__karma_char_encoding_namespace__. This is needed when doing basic operations
such as forcing lower or upper case. Examples:

    string("Hello")
    string(L"Hello")
    string(s)         // s is a std::string

`lit`, like `string`, also emits a string of characters. The main
difference is that `lit` does not consumes an attribute. A plain
string like `"hello"` or a `std::basic_string` is equivalent to a `lit`.
Examples:

    "Hello"
    lit("Hello")
    lit(L"Hello")
    lit(s)            // s is a std::string

[heading Header]

    // forwards to <boost/spirit/home/karma/string/lit.hpp>
    #include <boost/spirit/include/karma_string.hpp>

Also, see __include_structure__.

[heading Namespace]

[table
    [[Name]]
    [[`boost::spirit::lit // alias: boost::spirit::karma::lit`]]
    [[`ns::string`]]
]

In the table above, `ns` represents a __karma_char_encoding_namespace__ used by the 
corresponding string generator. 

[heading Model of]

[:__primitive_generator_concept__]

[variablelist Notation
    [[`s`]        [Character-class specific string (See __char_class_types__),
                   or a __karma_lazy_argument__ that evaluates to a 
                   character-class specific string value]]
    [[`S`]        [The type of a character-clas specific string `s`.]]
    [[`ns`]       [A __karma_char_encoding_namespace__.]]]

[heading Expression Semantics]

Semantics of an expression is defined only where it differs from, or is
not defined in __primitive_generator_concept__.

[table
    [[Expression]           [Description]]
    [[`s`]                  [Generate the string literal `s`. This generator 
                             never fails (unless the underlying output stream 
                             reports an error).]]
    [[`lit(s)`]             [Generate the string literal `s`. This generator 
                             never fails (unless the underlying output stream 
                             reports an error).]]
    [[`ns::string`]         [Generate the string provided by a mandatory 
                             attribute interpreted in the character set defined 
                             by `ns`. This generator never fails (unless the 
                             underlying output stream reports an error).]]
    [[`ns::string(s)`]      [Generate the string `s` as provided by the 
                             immediate literal value the generator is initialized 
                             from. If this generator has an associated attribute 
                             it succeeds only if the attribute is equal 
                             to the immediate literal (unless the underlying 
                             output stream reports an error). Otherwise this 
                             generator fails and does not generate any output.]]
]

[note   The generators `lit(s)` and `string(s)` can be initialized either 
        using a string literal value (i.e. `"abc"`), or using a 
        `std::basic_string<char_type, ...>`, where `char_type` is the required
        value type of the underlying character sequence.]

[heading Attributes]

[table
    [[Expression]           [Attribute]]
    [[`s`]                  [__unused__]]
    [[`lit(s)`]             [__unused__]]
    [[`ns::string`]         [`S`, attribute is mandatory (otherwise compilation 
                             will fail)]]
    [[`ns::string(s)`]      [`S`, attribute is optional, if it is supplied, the 
                             generator compares the attribute with `s` and 
                             succeeds only if both are equal, failing otherwise]]
]

[note  In addition to their usual attribute of type `S` all listed generators 
       accept an instance of a `boost::optional<S>` as well. If the 
       `boost::optional<>` is initialized (holds a value) the generators behave 
       as if their attribute was an instance of `S` and emit the value stored
       in the `boost::optional<>`. Otherwise the generators will fail.]

[heading Complexity]

[:O(N), where N is the number of characters emitted by the string generator]
